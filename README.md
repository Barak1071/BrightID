## A Personal Stamp of Uniqueness

BrightID uses the people you know (a trust graph) to enforce one-account-per-person for important applications like voting and universal basic income.

A BrightID proves you're a unique person.

BrightIDs have the following characteristics:
* Can be used anonymously. [No personal data or biometrics are used for verification](https://www.brightid.org/faq).
* Verified by a trusted group of close personal contacts plus a [decentralized graph database](#decentralized-and-owner-free).
* A lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts.

## Decentralized & Anonymous

The network consists of volunteers [running nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node). Nodes host the trust graph used for verification, but there's no personal information stored there.

## Mobile App

ID creation and connectons to people and apps are managed though the [BrightID mobile app](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki/BrightID---Full-Mobile-Spec).

## API

[We offer an API to third-parties](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-API) to connect to the BrightID mobile app and BrightID nodes to verify users as unique.

## Contribute

See our [wiki](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki) for dev instructions.
