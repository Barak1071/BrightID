We're building a social platform around real-world interactions that establishes the uniqueness of its users.

Uniqueness of users is important to applications such as universal basic income, voting, group decision-making and reputation systems.  We're building a social platform to support these.

Our current focus is to build a [mobile app](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside/wiki/Brightside-Mobile).

## Establishing the uniqueness of users

[Brightside Unique](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside-unique) analyzes the social graph to protect against duplicate accounts (sybils).

## Decentralized

We're decentralized.  There's no organization to capture personal information and sell it to advertisers.  Data (including photos and names) stay with the person who created them and the contacts with whom they choose to share. There's no central server holding this information. 

Anyone can [run a node in our system](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside-node) to host the social graph.

## Contribute

Check out our [open projects](https://github.com/orgs/Brightside-Social/projects).  Or [start a new Issue](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside/issues) and we'll add you to the conversation.

This repo is for our mobile app.
