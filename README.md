## A Personal Stamp of Uniqueness

BrightID is an identity network providing proof-of-unique-personhood. A brightID is a socially unique identifier verified through graph analysis.

BrightIDs have the following characteristics:
* Can be used anonymously. [No personal data or biometrics are used for verification](https://www.brightid.org/faq).
* Verified by a trusted group of close personal contacts plus a [decentralized graph database](#decentralized-and-owner-free).
* A lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts.

## Decentralized & Anonymous

The network consists of volunteers [running nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node). Nodes host the trust graph used for verification, but there's no personal information stored there.

## Mobile App

ID creation and connectons to people and apps are managed though the [brightID mobile app](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki/BrightID---Full-Mobile-Spec).

## API

[We offer an API to third-parties](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-API) to connect to the brightID mobile app and brightID nodes to verify users as unique.
