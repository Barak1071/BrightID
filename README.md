Our mission is to provide everyone with an ID that shows they're a unique person without requiring personal data.

Unlike most IDs--which are used to prove who you are--BrightIDs are used to prove that you're a unique person and can be used anonymously.

BrightIDs have the following characteristics:
* Verified by a trusted group of close personal contacts plus a [decentralized social graph owned by no one](#decentralized-and-owner-free).
* No data is stored with the ID.  A person can show they're unique without sharing any data.
* A lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts.

## Where Can a BrightID be Used?
Businesses that care about limiting fake and duplicate accounts while preserving user privacy accept BrightIDs.

There are several kinds of apps that work better when everyone in the system is unique.  You can authorize these apps to use BrightID to verify that you're unique without sharing any personal information.  In many cases, a BrightID can be used to register instead of your name, email address, phone number, or other identifying information.  You remain anonymous, but verified as unique.

Examples of apps that benefit from verifying their users as unique using BrightID:
* Social networks like Facebook
* Rating sites like Yelp
* Online communities
* Referral systems
* Giveaways

## A World Without Boundaries

A BrightID is a proof of world citizenship.  

Boundary-preserving IDs like state-issued IDs require central agencies and intrusive checks; BrightIDs don't.

Global initiatives such as Universal Basic Income or worldwide votes can use BrightIDs to include everyone while keeping out fakes and duplicates.

## Decentralized and Owner-Free

There's no organization controlling BrightID. The network consists of volunteers [running nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node).  Nodes host the social graph used for verification, but there's no personal information stored there.

## Personal Data

It's up to you to safeguard your own personal data by choosing carefully with whom to share once you've connected with a person or app on BrightID.  BrightID lets you share your name and picture with contacts for identification purposes, but it doesn't ask you to share them with businesses or apps.

## Mobile App

ID creation and connectons to people, sites and apps are managed though the [BrightID mobile app](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki/BrightID-Mobile).

## API for Businesses

[We offer an API to third-party apps](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Service) to connect to the BrightID mobile app and verify users as unique.
