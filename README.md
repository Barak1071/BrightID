Our mission is to provide everyone with an ID that can be used to verify they're a unique individual without any connection to a central authority.

The ID will have the following characteristics:
* verification comes from a trusted group of one's closest personal contacts plus a decentralized social graph that's owned by no one
* uniqueness and data are kept separate.  A person can show they're unique without sharing any data.
* a lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts

Personal uniqueness is important to applications such as universal basic income, voting, rating systems, referrals, and giveaways.  We're building a social platform to support these.

Our current focus is to build a [mobile app](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki/BrightID-Mobile).

## Establishing the uniqueness of users

[We offer an API to third-party apps](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Service) to connect to our service.

## Decentralized

We're decentralized.  There's no organization to capture personal information and sell it to advertisers.  Data (including photos and names) stay with the person who created them and the contacts with whom they choose to share.

Anyone can [run a node in our system](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node) to host the social graph.

## Contribute

Check out our [open projects](https://github.com/orgs/BrightID/projects).  Or [start a new Issue](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/issues) and we'll add you to the conversation.

This repo is for our mobile app.

See our [dev setup](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki/Development-Guide) for instructions on how to run the application.
