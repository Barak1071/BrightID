We're building a social platform that captures the value of face-to-face interactions.

By capturing this value, we can support a variety of applications such as universal basic income, voting, group decision-making and reputation systems, while providing a social network around these interactions.

Our current focus is to build a [mobile app](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside/wiki/Brightside-Mobile).

## Users are Unique

Brightside helps applications know their users are unique. We offer [Brightside Unique](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside-unique) as a solution.

## Decentralized

We're decentralized.  There's no organization to capture your information and sell it to advertisers.  There are no central servers storing your information. Your personal information stays with you and with your contacts with whom you choose to share.

Anyone can [run a node in our system](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside-node) to host the social graph.

## Contribute

Check out our [open projects](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside/projects).  Or [start a new Issue](https://github.com/Brightside-Social/brightside/issues) and we'll add you to the conversation.

This repo is for our mobile app.
