## Social Identity Network

BrightID allows people to prove to applications that they're only using account.

BrightIDs have the following characteristics:
* [No personal data or biometrics are used for verification](https://www.brightid.org/faq).
* Verified by a trusted group of close personal contacts plus a [decentralized graph database](#decentralized--nonintrusive).
* A lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts.

### Decentralized & Nonintrusive

The network consists of volunteers [running nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node). Nodes host the social graph used for verification, but there's no personal information stored there.

## Mobile App

ID creation and connectons to people and apps are managed though the BrightID mobile app.
