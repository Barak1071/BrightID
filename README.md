Our mission is to provide everyone with an ID that can be used to verify their individuality without central authorities.

The ID will have the following characteristics:
* Verified by a trusted group of close personal contacts plus a [decentralized social graph owned by no one](#decentralized-graph).
* Individuality and data are kept separate.  A person can show they're unique without sharing any data.
* A lost or compromised ID can be replaced by reconnecting with a few close personal contacts.
* Individuality can be shared with third-party apps that extend capabilities to the ID holder.

## Mobile App

The ID, personal connections, and connections to third-party apps are managed though the [BrightID mobile app](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID/wiki/BrightID-Mobile).

## Third-Party Applications
There are several kinds of apps that work better when every user in the system is a unique person.  When you make a one-time connection to an app with BrightID, it will be able to know that you're unique.

Examples of apps that benefit from connecting to BrightID are:
* Universal Basic Income
* Online Voting
* Rating Systems
* Gift Economies
* Online Communities
* Referral Systems
* Giveaways

[We offer an API to third-party apps](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Service) to connect to the BrightID mobile app and verify a person's uniqueness.

## Decentralized Graph 

Anyone can [run a node](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node).  Nodes host the social graph used for verification, but they don't hold any personal information.

## Personal Data

It's up to individual users to safeguard their own personal data by choosing carefully with whom to share it (contacts or apps) once they've shared their ID with them.
